Meeting Mode
============

A Pebble watchface designed for office meetings.

## Features

### Clear time

Meeting Mode has a very large and clear display of the minutes past
the hour so it is easy to catch a glimpse of the time without being
too obvious in an important meeting.

### 5 minute vibration

Meeting Mode will also make your Pebble subtly vibrate every 5 minutes
so you can keep track of the time that has passed without having to
look at your wrist. It vibrates slightly every 5 minutes and gives a
distinctive double-vibrate every 15 minutes past the hour.

## Installing

Meeting mode is available for free in the Pebble appstore!

You can also install old versions of the app from the source code
using the SDK, or via the `pbw` files that are available in the
Releases section of this repository.

This watchface (as well as the other things I've developed for the
Pebble) will be available in the Pebble appstore soon.

## Issues / contact
