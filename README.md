Meeting Mode
============

A Pebble watchface designed for office meetings.

## Features

### Clear time

Meeting Mode has a very large and clear display of the minutes past
the hour so it is easy to catch a glimpse of the time without being
too obvious in an important meeting.

### Vibration to keep track of time's passage

Meeting Mode will make your Pebble subtly vibrate every 5 minutes so
you can keep track of the time that has passed without having to look
at your wrist. It vibrates slightly every 5 minutes, gives a
distinctive double-vibrate every 15 minutes past the hour and will do
a triple vibrate on the hour.

This means you shouldn't even need to look at the watchface to keep
track of how long your meeting has been.

## Installing

Meeting mode is available for free in the Pebble appstore!

You can also install old versions of the app from the source code
using the SDK, or via the `pbw` files that are available in the
Releases section of this repository.

## Issues / contact
