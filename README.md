Meeting Mode
============

A Pebble watchface designed for office meetings.

## Features

### Clear time

Meeting mode has a very large and clear display of the minutes past
the hour so it is easy to catch a glimpse of the time withoutbeing too
obvious in an important meeting.

### 5 minute vibration

Meeting mode will also make your Pebble subtly vibrate every 5 minutes
so you can keep track of the time that has passed without having to
look at your wrist. It vibrates slightly every 5 minutes and gives a
distinctive double-vibrate every 15 minutes past the hour.

## Installing

I haven't worked out how to publish Pebble apps yet. You can install
the app from the source code using the SDK, or via the `pbw` file that
will be available in the releases section of this repository.

This watchface (as well as the other things I've developed for the
Pebble) will be available in the Pebble appstore soon.

## Issues / contact

If you find any problems or generally have any questions or
suggestions, feel free to raise an issue on this repository. I'd love
to hear if you've found it helpful. Pull Requests are welcome :-)
